1 diff bet property binding and interpolation
Ans: button disable property is assignedto property 
string interpolation always transforms data to a string
so the button will be always disabled,whether the value is true or false.
when do not use Property binding ex: comment TextBox : Hacker may enter javascript code 
u should use string interpolation only for input type text
2 diff bet constructor and NgOnInit hook
both fired at the beginning of component life cycle
i constructor is a feature of typscript class and not Angular
